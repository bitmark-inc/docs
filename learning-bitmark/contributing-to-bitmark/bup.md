## What is BUP?
A Bitmark Upgrade Proposal (BUP) is a design document providing
information to the Bitmark community, or describing a new feature for
Bitmark or its processes or environment. The BUP shall provide a
concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the
feature.

## Where I can find the BUPs?
We maintain an entity at Github only for BUP, we want to keep a clean 
environment where developers will not have distraction with too many 
repos, that is the reason why we do not maintain it under the 
Bitmark documentation ![repository](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/docs).

To have full access to all BUPs, please access: ![Bitmark Upgrade Proposal](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/docs)
