# Working with Bitmarks

Interacting with Bitmark requires the creation of a Bitmark Account. Afterward, you can register Bitmark Certificates for your digital properties, which you may later transfer or divide into Bitmark Shares.

Most work with Bitmark can be done via one of three methods: the [Bitmark App](https://a.bitmark.com/) (for iOS or Android), the [Bitmark SDK](https://github.com/bitmark-inc) (for a variety of languages), or the Bitmark CLI (available as part of the [Bitcoin node](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/docs/blob/master/learning-bitmark/quick-start/simple-solution-for-node-setup.md). 


* The **Bitmark App** is a simple mobile app that allows anyone to protect their legal rights to their data and other digital assets by registering them as properties on the Bitmark blockchain.

* The **Bitmark SDK** is a collection of libraries for different programming languages and mobile platforms. In addition to providing language-specific bindings for the Bitmark APIs, the SDK also simplifies local key management for signing and encryption.

* The **Bitmark CLI** is a command line tool that allows a user to interact with the Bitmark blockchain by connecting to one or several nodes in the network. All transactions are submitted directly to one of these connected nodes and consequently are verified by the node before being forwarded to the network.

These documents detail the usage of each of these methods.
