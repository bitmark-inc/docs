#Transferring bitmarks 

Once an asset has been registered, trading it simply requires the owner to create a new transfer record that points back to the original issue record (or to the previous transfer record) and that shows the new owner of the asset. Because the blockchain is ordered and because it’s immutable, this creates a permanent chain of custody, reaching back to the asset’s origins.

## Transferring bitmarks using Bitmark App

The Bitmark app registers legal property rights on the public Bitmark blockchain for your digital assets, including personal health and social data, creative works such as art, photography, and music, and other intellectual property. These legal rights determine who owns property and what can be done with it, whether you want to keep it, sell it, or donate it.

<br>
Here are the steps to register a new property using the Bitmark app:

* On the PROPERTIES screen - Tap **CREATE FIRST PROPERTY** or **+** 

    > It opens the PROPERTIES > REGISTER screen

    <div style="background-color: #efefef; text-align: center;">
