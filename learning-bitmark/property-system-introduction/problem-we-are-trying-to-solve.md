# Bitmark Property System Introduction 

Digital assets and data feel ephemeral. It's easy to lose track of your digital assets; and it's easy to let social networks and other content aggregators claim ownership over your data. Hackers and 'bots can steal your digital properties, and today you might not have much recourse.

But it shouldn't be that way. 

Your digital assets and data have value to yourself, to other creators, and to our society as a whole. You should be able to exert your personal digital property rights and leverage that value to your benefit, but in today's world you can't.

That needs to change.

## Bitmark's Property System

The Bitmark Property System is the answer to these problems: the way to replicate the property rights of the physical world in the digital world. It's _the_ property system for establishing value and legal control over the worldâ€™s data.

* It allows you to **register** your digital assets and data, defining what the assets are in a special asset record, then issuing them to yourself as the initial owner.
* It also allows you to **transfer** your digital assets and data. You can sell an original asset or license a digital copy. You can make a personal transfer or do so as part of the Bitmark Markets -- which include marketplaces for specific digital properties.

With the Bitmark Property System, you can use Bitmark Certificates both to prove ownership of digital assets and data and to ensure irrevocable transfers of that property. It's a turnkey solution for enabling the monetization and trade of digital properties.

## Bitmark's Technology

The Bitmark Property System is built on the Bitmark blockchain. 

The blockchain is an exciting twenty-first century technology that allows for trustless digital interactions between a group of people. It centers on a distributed public ledger that doesn't depend on any centralized authority. Anyone can write permanent records to the ledger as long as they follow the proper protocols.

The records on the Bitmark blockchain are protected by cryptography. Assets are uniquely fingerprinted with hashes, and ownership is recorded with public keys and then confirmed with private-key signatures. Transfers of assets are verified with another signature from that same private key.

The Bitmark blockchain has been designed specifically for the issuance and transfer of digital property, so it doesn't have its own native cryptocurrency. However, payments for asset transfers can be made in either Bitcoins or Litecoins, then verified on the blockchains of those cryptocurrencies.

Miners, called recorders on the Bitmark blockchain, keep everything running. They assemble asset records, issue records, and transfer records into blocks, which are built with a proof-of-work system. Miners are incentivized to include issue records through a Bitmark certificate on the block itself and to include transfer records through a fee, also paid in Litecoin or Bitcoin.

By leveraging the power of other blockchains, Bitmark is able to focus on the registration and protection of digital assets and data, creating a new digital database of property for the twenty-first century.
