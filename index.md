# Official Documentation for Working with Bitmark

The Bitmark Property System allows individuals to use the Bitmark blockchain to register and acquire digital assets, giving them control over how they're used, transferred, licensed, or sold. It's a self-sovereign system that permits everyone to be the ultimate authority for their digital property.

__Learning the Bitmark Property System__ covers the basics: what the Bitmark Property System is, how to get involved, and how to register and transfer digital properties. A Quick Start discusses the specifics of doing so, using either the Bitmark App or one of Bitmark's lower level toolkits, such as its SDK or the Bitmark-CLI. _This is where to look for a tutorial on Bitmark._

The __References__ go into more specifics, focusing on the details of the Bitmark Property system and its toolkits. The _Node Software_ section describes how the basic protocols and data structures of the Bitmark Property System work; the _SDK_ section documents how to use Go, Java, JavaScript, and Swift libraries to interact with the Bitmark Property System; and the _CLI_ section reveals how to use the `bitcoin-cli` command to work with the Bitmark Property System from the command line. _This is where to look for the details of Bitmark structures and commands._

The __Appendices__ complete the documentation with articles discussing the foundations of the Bitmark Property System and the Bitmark Shares system as well as how they differ from Ethereum tokens. _This is where to look for more theoretical discussions of the Bitmark Property System._
