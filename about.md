# Mission
***Our mission is to define digital property, defend it, and make it economically divisible.***

Bitmark enables ownership and property rights to digital assets of value such as health data, art, digital collectibles, song rights, and medical records. Our tools, apps, and products create secure pathways for trading digital assets and help unlock new markets and economic activity for these properties.

Bitmark is the property system for establishing value and legal control over the world’s data. Property rights were invented for land (real property) and then ideas (intellectual property), but none extend to the digital world. Digital assets can easily be duplicated and shared without consent. If such assets cannot be owned as property with established property rights, they essentially become valueless. Long before digital assets, the same problem existed for physical assets such as land, resulting in a social situation known as the tragedy of the commons; land was abused because there was no individual incentive to protect it. Once land ownership rights became clearly defined and defended however, land cultivation was incentivized, resulting in wealth generation for the individual and state.

Bitmark creates tools to help anyone define digital property through property titles ("bitmark certificates") and to facilitate economic trade of those titles between individuals, governments, corporations, and institutions at global scale.

Data is the world’s next major asset class. Bitmark defends this evolution of property rights—beyond physical property, past intellectual property—for data and digital assets.
