# Control access

The control access feature of the Bitmark Property System allows a user to temporarily give another user permission to utilize a digital asset that they own. This is the equivalent of a loan or a rental. A library could lend a digital book to a patron, a newspaper could sell researchers a subscription to their news archives, or a musician could give an online service the right to stream their music, all for a limited time. This is the final building block in Bitmark's digital-asset ecosystem â€” allowing not just the creation and transfer of assets, but also the ability to license them, so that the digital properties can be used and reused, and so that the owner can profit from them over time.

**The usage instruction will be updated as soon as the feature is available.**
