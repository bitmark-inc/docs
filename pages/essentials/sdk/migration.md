# Account migration

Bitmark SDK provides `rekey` method to allow users to transfer all bitmarks from an `Account` to another one. This is helpful in case users want to migrate all their own bitmarks from old `Account` to another new one and keep the bitmarks provenance as well.

The method takes different `Account` as source and destination one and return the collection of new transaction id when complete.

```swift
let source = try Account();
let destination = try Account();

let (account, bitmarkids) = Migration.rekey(from: source, to: destination) { (txIds, error) in
    // collection of new tx id is returned here
    print(txIds)
}
```

                new Callback1<List<String>>() {

                    public void onSuccess(List<String> txIds) {
                        // collection of new tx id is returned here
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onError(Throwable e) {
                        // handle error here
                    }
