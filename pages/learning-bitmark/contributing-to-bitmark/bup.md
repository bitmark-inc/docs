# Bitmark Upgrade Proposal
## What is BUP?
A Bitmark Upgrade Proposal (BUP) is a design document providing
information to Bitmark community, or describing a new feature for
Bitmark or its processes or environment. A BUP shall provide a
concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the
feature.

## Where I can find the BUPs?
We maintain an entity at Github only for BUP, we want to keep a clean 
environment where developers will not have distraction with other
repos, this is the reason why we do not maintain it under
Bitmark documentation [repository](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/docs).

To have full access to all BUPs, please access: [Bitmark Upgrade Proposal](https://github.com/bitmark-property-system/bups)
