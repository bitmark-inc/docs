# Bitmark Upgrade Proposal
## What is a BUP?
A Bitmark Upgrade Proposal (BUP) is a design document providing
information to the Bitmark community or describing a new feature for
Bitmark or its processes or environment. A BUP provides a
concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for it.

## Where I can find the BUPs?
We have a repo at Github specifically for BUPs. We do not maintain it as part of the
Bitmark documentation [repository](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/docs) because we want that to be a clean 
environment where developers are not distracted by other
repos.

For full access to all BUPs, please go to: [Bitmark Upgrade Proposal](https://github.com/bitmark-property-system/bups)
