# Glossary

**Account** — _See Bitmark Account._

**ancillary information** — Information placed on the _Bitmark blockchain_ in addition to the _Bitmark certificate_ (and potentially the _digital asset_ or _data_ itself).

**asset record** — A _record_ on the _Bitmark blockchain_ that details information about a _digital property_. You _register_ an asset record.

**asset** — Something of value. Usually a shorthand for _digital asset_.

**authenticate (v.) — to prove that you are who you say you are, or that a _property_ is what it purports to be, as opposed to _verify_.

**Bitcoin** — The technology behind the _bitcoin_ currency.

**bitcoins** — The currency enabled by the _Bitcoin_ technology.

**Bitmark** — The name of a company that creates systems to manage _digital property_ rights. 

**Bitmark Account** — A user account at Bitmark containing a _public key_ and a _private key_. It links to _Bitmark certificates_ on the _Bitmark blockchain_ and allows a property owner to _record_, track, and trade their _digital assets_ and _data_.

**Bitmark Account Number** — A public key identifying a _Bitmark Account_.

**Bitmark API** — A programming interface that allows programmers to interface with the _Bitmark Property System_. It is an Open Rest API.

**Bitmark blockchain** — The _blockchain_ used by Bitmark to record _Bitmark certificates_. It is both decentralized and distributed and is also open, public, and free. Also called the _Bitmark public blockchain_ or the _Bitmark public blockchain ledger_.

**Bitmark certificate** — A unique identifier that provides a record of _property rights_ for _digital assets and data_. Technically, this is either an _issue record_ or a _transfer record_ that records the current ownership of a _digital property_, associated with an _asset record_ that describes what the digital property is.

**Bitmark Health** — An iPhone app.

**Bitmark Property System** — The _digital assets and data_ management system that consists of the _Bitmark blockchain_, the _Bitmark Account_, and other tools.

**Bitmark Registry** — A web app that acts as an index to the _Bitmark blockchain_.

**Bitmark SDK** — A collection of language-specific software development kits that provide bindings to the _Bitmark API_ and simplify local key management for signing and encryption.

**bitmarkd** - The main Bitmark program. It verifies and records transactions on the _Bitmark blockchain_.

**Bitmark CLI** - A command line interface for interacting with _bitmarkd_ (and thus the _Bitmark Property System_.

**Bitmark Wallet** - A wallet that allows a _recorder_ to receive _bitcoins_ and _litecoins_.

**bitmark-webui** - A web-based user interface to monitor and configure a Bitmark _node_ via a web browser.

**block** - The basic unit of data in a _blockchain_. Each block contains transactions (or other _records_ and points back to the previous block on the blockchain.

**blockchain** — A technology that creates _blocks_ of transactions (or other data) that are linked together to create a chain going back from the present to a Genesis block. Also, a specific instance of the blockchain technology that has created a linked chain of blocks used for some purpose. The _Bitmark blockchain_ and the _Bitcoin_ blockchain are two examples.

**cryptocurrency** — Digital currencies such as _bitcoins_ or _litecoins_.

**data** — Information that is stored in a digital form: digital data. 

**decentralized** — A _distributed_ system that has no single-point-of-failure.

**digital asset** - Something of value that exist solely or primarily in digital form.

**digital assets and data** — The two primary sorts of _digital property_ protected by the _Bitmark Property System_: things of value and information.

**digital estate** — A collection of digital assets and digital data of value.

**digital property** — A shorthand for either a _digital asset_ or _data_, since it encompasses both.

**distributed** — A system that is divided among many nodes. This is a superset of _decentralized_.

**Hashcash calculation** — A proof-of-work calculation used to pay for an issue record.

**issue record** — A _record_ on the _Bitmark blockchain_ that _records_ the initial ownership of a _digital property_. You record an issue record (or an issuance).

**key pair** - A pair of linked keys used in Public-key cryptography: a _private key_ and a _public key_.

**Litecoin** — The technology behind the _litecoin_ currency.

**litecoins** — The currency enabled by the _Litecoin_ technology.

**miner** - Someone who creates blocks. On the _Bitmark blockchain_, they are instead called a _recorder_.

**node** or **Bitmark node** — A computer that runs the _Bitmark blockchain_. Typically this refers to a full node that contains the full contents of the _Bitmark blockchain_. It runs _bitmarkd_ and _recorderd_.

**private key** — Half of a _key pair_. The private key is part of a _Bitmark account_ and protects _Bitmark certificates_ on the _Bitmark blockchain_. The other half is the _public key_.

**proof-of-work** - A method of Sybil control used to protect _blockchains_, including the _Bitmark blockchain_. The other primary method of Sybil control is [proof-of-stake](https://medium.com/@bitmark/a-philosophy-of-blockchain-what-would-satoshi-nakamoto-think-of-proof-of-stake-f9aac8e4d005).

**property** — Something that is owned. Usually a shorthand for _digital property_. 

**property owner** — The legal holder of a property. A property owner can be an individual, institution, or organization.

**property rights** — Economic constructs that allow a _property owner_ to control  _property_.

**public key** — Half of a _key pair_. The public key is part of a _Bitmark account_; to be precise, it is the _Bitmark Account Number_. The other half of the key pair is the _private key_.

**record** - Information stored on a _blockchain_ to record information. On the _Bitmark blockchain_, records are used to record property rights and generate _Bitmark certificates_.

**record (v.)** — The act of recording a change in _property rights_. You might record an _issue record_ or a _transfer record_. For an _asset record_, you instead _register_.

**recorder** — Someone who creates _blocks_ by adding _records_ to the _Bitmark blockchain_. On other _blockchains_ they are instead called a _miner_.

**recorderd** - The Bitmark mining program, run by _recorders_. It allows _nodes_ to compete with _proof-of-work_ to make _blocks_.

**recovery phrase** - a set of 12 mnemonic words that can be used to restore a _private key_.

**register (v.)** — The act of recording initial property rights. You might register a _digital asset_ or register an _asset record_. You can register multiple rights on the _Bitmark blockchain_.

**transfer record** — A _record_ on the _Bitmark blockchain_ that describes the transfer of a _digital property_ to a new owner. You _record_ a transfer record (or a transfer).

**verify (v.)** — To prove that someone’s identity data matches with who they are, as opposed to _authenticate_s.
